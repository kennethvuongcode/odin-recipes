    <h2>Tonkotsu Ramen - Who doesn't like ramen?</h2>

    <p>There is a ramen place called Daikokuya in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles. They sell tonkotsu ramen, and the first time I had it I was blown away.
        While tonkotsu ramen was never my all time favorite, it is a consistent dish I can always rely on to be good.
        I remember when I was a kid, I used to go shop around all the japanese stores with my cousins. 
        We'd buy merch from different mangas/animes, and end the day with a nice hot bowl of ramen :)
