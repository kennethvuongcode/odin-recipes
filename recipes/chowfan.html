    <p>I would have this all the time at my house, there's a funny connection I have to chow fan too actually.
        When I was a baby first learning to walk, my parents had brought a bowl of chow fan in front of me.
        I would crawl and crawl, and as they pulled the bowl further I had learned to walk! I caught up to the bowl and 
        had my first memory as a kid :)
